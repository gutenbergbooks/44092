<p><i>This plate, taken from a Japanese coloured woodcut,
illustrates well the voluminous nature of the mediæval ceremonial
garments. The figure is that of an ancient warrior
of the Taira clan, to which Kagekiyo belonged (<span class="plainfont">see p. <a href="#Page_53">53</a></span>),
who was noted also for the high quality of his poetry. He
composed a special verse, which he fastened in an arrow
that he always carried in his quiver, and that proved to be
the means of identification when he was found by his
enemies, dead in the field of battle. In the illustration
one may particularly note the mask, with the eyebrows
painted so high on the forehead that they are above the
fillet band. The feet are not bare, but are covered with
the white <span class="plainfont">tabi</span>, or cotton boots with soft soles and a
separate division for the big toe, in which the <span class="plainfont">Nō</span> dancers
always perform their parts.</i>

<p>By His Excellency the Japanese Ambassador</p>


<p>The <i>utai</i> does not appeal to the uneducated, and for
that reason its devotees have practically been confined
to the gentle and aristocratic classes. In the days before
the educational system of Japan was established on
Western lines, boys of the <i>Samurai</i> class in many parts
of the country were taught to chant the <i>utai</i> in their
schools as a part of their curriculum, the object being
to ennoble their character by imbuing them with the
spirit of the olden times, and also to provide for them
a healthy means of recreation in their manhood. Along
with many other institutions, it declined in favour in
consequence of the great social and political upheaval
which ushered in the era of <i>Meiji</i>; and for some time
afterwards the people were too much occupied with
various material aspects of life to find any leisure for
the cultivation of the art, so much so that its professional
exponents, meeting with no public support, had
to give up the forlorn attempt to continue their task
and to look elsewhere for a means of earning their
livelihood.</p>

<p>With the consolidation of the new régime many old
things took a new lease of life, the <i>utai</i> being one of
them. Not only has the <i>utai</i> revived, but those who
ought to know say that never in the long history of
its existence has it been so extensively patronised as it
is to-day. Patrons of the art are by no means confined
to the aristocratic classes, albeit it is not so popular as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
the ordinary theatrical play, and never could be from
the nature of the thing.</p>

<p>This book will, therefore, well repay study on the
part of any one desirous of knowing and appreciating
the working of the Japanese mind, and the author and
her colleague are rendering a good service to the public
of the West by initiating them into the subject. As
the author frankly admits, to translate the <i>utai</i> into a
European language is a most difficult task, and, in my
opinion, it is a well-nigh impossible one. The meaning
of the original may be conveyed&mdash;its spirit to a certain
extent&mdash;but never the peculiarities of the original
language, on which the beauty of the <i>utai</i> mainly rests.
It was very brave of Dr. Marie Stopes and Prof.
Sakurai to undertake what I should deem an impossible
task, and I am glad to be able to extend to them my
sincere congratulations on their remarkable achievement.
They have succeeded in their work to the best
extent any one can hope to succeed, and in my opinion
have placed Western students of Japanese art and
literature under a debt of gratitude to them.</p>

<p>Their poetry is the expressed essence of the Japanese.
It represents them as the Victory of Samothrace represents
the people of Greece, as the scent represents the
rose. Chamberlain says, “The one original product
of the Japanese mind is the native poetry”&mdash;their
painting, their porcelain, their ceremonials, are modifications
of Chinese classics, but their poetry is their
very own. Among the greatest and most characteristic
treasures of the native literature, the Japanese rank
their ancient “lyric dramas,” the <i>Nō</i>. As Synge and
the Irish poets speak for the Irish people the things
that matter most to them and that yet go all unexpressed
in their outward life, in the same sense, only
to a greater extent, do the <i>Nō</i> dramas represent the old
spirit of Japan.</p>

<p>In Japanese the texts of the <i>Nō</i> dramas, all of which
were written before the sixteenth century, are collected
in a great work, the <i>Yokyoku Tsukai</i>, in which various
editions give as many as two hundred and thirty-five
to two hundred and sixty-two <i>utai</i>, as the librettos of
the <i>Nō</i> are called. Yet these treasures are practically
unknown to the reading public of the West, notwithstanding
the interest that has been taken in “things
Japanese.” Scholars certainly have paid them some attention,
and a few <i>utai</i> have been rendered into English,
but in most cases these translations are such as appeal
primarily to scholars, and do not reach the wider public.
Chamberlain’s <i>Classical Poetry of the Japanese</i>, in which
some of the <i>utai</i> find a place, is perhaps the only exception
to the general statement that no rendering of any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
these plays has yet been made which is calculated to win
those readers who do not delve in the Transactions of
learned societies nor read transliterated texts in weighty
volumes, but who, nevertheless, delight in the great
literatures of the world.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for this is certainly the extreme
remoteness of the subject from everything to which we
are accustomed, and the difficulty of translating into
our own the obscure language of these mediæval texts.</p>

<p>All students of Japanese are agreed about the excessive
difficulty of making any rendering from the <i>utai</i>
which combines fidelity to the original with lucidity
in a European language.</p>

<p>Yet these old plays are unique, exquisite, individual,
and so full of charm that it is a great loss to the Western
world that they should be entirely removed from our
ken by being hedged in and shut away from us by the
difficulties of language. It is clearly some one’s duty
to translate, not merely the words of these plays, but
their meaning and spirit, so that the Western public
may have partial access at least to the source that
delights, and has delighted for centuries, the best minds
of our Allies in the East. No translation can ever
convey more than a fraction of the power, beauty, and
individual characteristics of the original, but it is my
hope that there may be found between these covers
something of the delicacy and charm of the <i>Nō</i>, some
hint of their peculiar flavour and effect. If this consummation
is in any single case achieved by this book,
it will be, I fancy, only after the whole of it has been
read and laid down; when a faint spirit of the <i>Nō</i> may
take shape in the reader’s mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Mountains blue in the distance before which we
stand enthralled are composed of grey rough stone and
broken screes when viewed at nearer quarters&mdash;yet we
enjoy not less the illusory blue. The words of a stirring
poem that wafts us into a fairy land of dreams
are each one commonplace enough, and each can be
reduced to its elements, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>,&mdash;twenty-six of
them, which can be ranged in a straight line.</p>

<p>And so it is with the <i>Nō</i>. They must not be too
much analysed and inquired into. Their language is
simple, almost to baldness in places, it is true, but
their simple elements create a wonderland of illusion.
In Japanese they have the power to make the spirit
soar into the borders of the enchanted regions of
romance; and when acted the plays make one ache with
<i>Weltschmerz</i> in a way that shows that their place is
among the great things of our world, elemental in their
simplicity. Then it must not be forgotten that the text
of the drama as presented is accompanied by music,
and is chanted by highly trained actors in a beautiful
setting. Who would think of judging Wagner from
the texts of his librettos alone, and of ignoring his
power as a scene creator and a musician? The texts
of the <i>Nō</i> are largely prosy, if you will. Mr. Sansom
recently censured me, and with me the leading Japanese
authorities on the subject, for our appreciation of the
poetry of the <i>Nō</i>. He would have us believe that the
steady popularity of these plays for six hundred years
among the leading men of the country, from priests
and poets to princes and warriors, is due to over-estimation,
and that they are, after all, mostly prose of
no high quality. In a language so widely diverging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
from our own in its construction and mode of thought
as Japanese, the details of the literary style and composition
are beyond reach of my judgment. As the
Japanese for so long have been consistent in their
admiration of the literary construction of the <i>Nō</i>, I am
content in that matter to accept their verdict. But of
the atmosphere and general effect of the plays I can
judge for myself, and I find them among the supremely
great things in world-literature. That Mr. Sansom
does not, depends on his own taste in the matter. I
have, in these modern days of unshackled opinion,
heard people openly announce that they saw nothing in
Shakespeare! I fancy that if we could translate
literally into the English language the song of the
nightingale to its mate, it would be found to be largely
composed of mundane affairs and prosy gossip about
its neighbours, the weather and the marauding school-boy.
But is it to us any the less romantic and glorious
in association? There is a focal distance for every
work of art, and if we choose to overstep it and go and
rub our noses against the canvas of supreme genius,
we will only find smeary paint and an unpleasant
odour. So, acknowledging the prosy elements in the
texts of the <i>Nō</i> I have attempted to render, I present
them in the hope that there will be some readers who
will see through the shrouding veils of a foreign
language something of the features of the eternal loveliness
of the original. My great regret is the imperfections
of my handling of these delicate fantasies. But
with the exceptional knowledge and gifts of my collaborator
in the translations, Prof. Sakurai, the standard
of detailed accuracy has been kept up to a point which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
will, I trust, make these translations not entirely
unworthy of a scholar’s perusal (but see p. <a href="#Page_32">32</a>); nevertheless,
the reader whom my heart desires is not one to
take too close an inspection of each detail, but one
who will catch the spirit of the whole. None of the
four plays that follow have been translated by any one
else,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> so far as I can discover; so that, as they break
new ground for it, the public will perhaps be lenient
and sympathetic towards these efforts.</p>


<h3>Concerning the Place the <i>Nō</i> takes
in Japan to-day</h3>

<p>In Japan to-day there still lingers much of the old
aristocratic scorn of the common theatre, but the
theatres which are dedicated to the performance of the
<i>Nō</i> have no such stigma attached to them. Indeed,
these performances are almost entirely supported by
the gentle and aristocratic classes. The interest of
intellectual men in these plays is not even satisfied with
on-looking, and many of the leading men of the day
in Tokio&mdash;lawyers, university professors, statesmen
and aristocrats&mdash;study the chants and songs and give
private recitals of them. A few even undertake the
arduous training necessary to act a complete part, including
the “dancing,” and then the gentlemen are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
proud to appear with distinguished professionals. The
only comparable enthusiasm in our country is that of
the Shakespeare societies; but even to act, and act well,
a part in a Shakespeare play requires an amount of
application trivial in comparison with that necessary
completely to master a rôle in one of the <i>Nō</i>. For in
“singing” the <i>utai</i> not only is every minute inflection
of the voice prescribed and regulated according to the
severest rules, but every movement of the body, every
step and movement even of the toes or little fingers
in the “dance” that accompanies it, is most strictly
governed by an iron tradition, and the secret of some
of the parts is only in the hands of a few masters.</p>

<p>Mr. Sansom quotes, in an unsympathetic spirit, the
opinion of Mr. Tanaka Shohei, but as this opinion
represents in substance that of a number of the leading
Japanese who interest themselves in the subject, I think
it may very well be given as an expression of current
opinion of the <i>Nō</i>: “From every point of view it is
one of the pre-eminent arts of the world. It is the
flower of the Yamato stock. Every art reflects the
spirit of a given people at a given time, and, remembering
this, we must hold it remarkable that the affections
of our people should be retained by an art which
arose six hundred years ago. In the West there is
no art with such a pedigree. This shows that the <i>Nō</i>
represents the national spirit, and is complete in every
respect.”</p>

<p>A Japanese professor, writing to me, says, “A <i>Nō</i>
drama is always very simple in its plot, and it is chiefly
its peculiar poetical construction and ring which appeal
so much to our emotion and give the charm it pos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>sesses.”
Another opinion is quoted by Mr. Osman
Edwards: “The words (of the <i>Nō</i>) are gorgeous,
splendid and even magnificent as are the costumes.”</p>

<p>The charm of the <i>Nō</i> is a cumulative one, and its
power of conveying much meaning in simple action is
largely augmented by the suggestiveness of the interwoven
allusions to the classical poems partly quoted or
suggested in the words of the texts. Almost every
word carries more than its face value, and has been
enriched by centuries of usage in innumerable poetical
and traditional connections.</p>


<h3>Concerning the past History of the <i>Nō</i></h3>

<p>The <i>Nō</i>, as they are now preserved, date principally
from the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, and
all of them are prior to the sixteenth century. Their
development took place under the Ashikaga Shogunate,
particularly in the reign of the Shogun Yoshimitsu
(1368-1394), when they soon became exceedingly successful
among the nobles. They are to a large extent
compounded from much older elements which existed
in a more incoherent form prior to the fourteenth
century; but they may be described as crystallising and
taking their distinctive form under the hands of
<i>Kiyotsugu</i>, who lived from 1355 to 1406. It is of
great interest to note how closely the dates of our own
Chaucer (1340-1400) correspond with those of the
great Japanese master. What world-phase brought
two such men to the front at the same time in the two
island empires, all unknown to each other? Kiyotsugu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
was the founder of the <i>Nō</i> proper, and one of his pieces
is given on p. <a href="#Page_39">39</a>. It is certain that he did not suddenly
evolve this type of drama, but took the elements that
were to hand and fused them together with the flux
of his personal genius. Chief among the material available
were the <i>Kagura</i> or pantomime dances which were
performed at Shinto festivals on temporary wooden
platforms. Direct descendants of these, nearly in their
original form, have lingered on till the present day.
I have seen performances on the rough temporary platforms,
where the actors were gaudily but cheaply
decked and where the crowded audience was almost
entirely composed of the common people who stood
semi-scornful for a few moments, or were detained for
a long time while passing on their daily business. The
antiquity of such performances can be imagined from
the fact that in the <i>Kojiki</i>, which was written in 712
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, they were described as being ancient and their
origin was associated with the sun goddess. The
mythical story of their origin is one of the well-known
tales of Japan. The sun goddess, Amaterasu, was
offended and retired to a cave, withdrawing her luminous
beauty from the world. As may be imagined, this
was very inconvenient for every one, including the rest
of the gods, who in their distress assembled on the dry
bed of the River of Heaven. (This is the Milky Way,
and to one who knows the mountain rivers of Japan
it gives a very telling little touch, for the dry bed of
a Japanese river is a broad curve of round white stones.)
They endeavoured in many ways to lure the sun goddess
out of her cave, and at last they invented a dance
and performed it on the top of an inverted empty tub,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
which echoed when the dancer stamped. This excited
her curiosity, and the goddess was successfully drawn
out of her hiding-place, the light of her radiance once
more blessed the earth, and all was right again with
gods and men. The stamping on the hollow tub is
still suggested in the “dancing” of the <i>Nō</i>, where
the actor raises his foot and stamps once or twice with
force enough to make the specially prepared wooden
floor of the stage echo with a characteristic sound.</p>

<p>It is quite probable that the actual words of the
<i>utai</i> (librettos) of the <i>Nō</i> were partly, if not entirely,
written by Buddhist monks, and Kiyotsugu was only
responsible for bringing the whole together and stage
managing and stereotyping the plays.</p>

<p>Following Kiyotsugu, who died in 1406, was his
son <i>Motokiyo</i> (one of whose plays will be found on
p. <a href="#Page_56">56</a>), who lived from 1373-1455. As well as adding
to the number of the actual plays (as many as ninety-three
are attributed to him) he greatly improved the
music. By the time of his nephew some of the several
different schools of <i>Nō</i> interpreters, which are still in
existence, had sprung up.</p>

<p>The ruling Shoguns paid great attention to the <i>Nō</i>.
Kiyotsugu the founder was taken by the Shogun into
his immediate service and was even given the rank of
a small daimio. Both Hideoshi and Iyeyasu, two of
the greatest men in Japanese history, were not only
fond of witnessing the plays, but it is reported that they
actually took part in them among the actors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>


<h3>Concerning the Presentation of the <i>Nō</i></h3>

<p>A single <i>Nō</i> play is not a lengthy performance, the
average time for its complete presentation being merely
one hour. But a performance of <i>Nō</i> at a theatre
generally lasts a whole day (except at special short performances,
mostly arranged in connection with festivities),
because half-a-dozen pieces are on the programme,
and between each is given one of the “mad-words,” or
<i>Hiogen</i>, which are short, ludicrous farces, and which
serve to relieve the tension of the higher, and generally
tragic pieces.</p>


<h3>The Theatre</h3>

<p>The theatres, which are specially built for the <i>Nō</i>
performances, are smaller than the common theatres.
The stage is a square platform, generally measuring
about eighteen feet, which stands towards the middle,
so that the audience sit on three sides of it. This stage
has its own beautifully curved roof, which is separated
from the roof over the audience by a slight gap, and
is reminiscent of the time when the <i>Nō</i> were performed
on the outdoor wooden platforms while the audience
stood round in rain or shine. On the stage itself are
two pillars of smooth wood, which support its roof (see
diagram facing p. <a href="#Page_12">10</a>). The stage is horizontal and is
raised a few feet above the ground; it is made of very
smooth and peculiarly resonant boarding, which is of
special importance in the “dancing,” in the course of
which the actor has to stamp at intervals with his shoeless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
feet and yet to make a loud, though deadened sound.
Let us not forget the inverted tub and the sun goddess.
This feature of the dancing is not to be despised, for
its effectiveness is notable. By the kindness of the
Secretary of the Royal Society of Literature I am
allowed to reproduce my plan of the <i>Nō</i> stage<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> from
their Transactions, so I am tempted to quote also a
paragraph describing it. “Leading to the stage is a
gallery nine feet wide, along which the actors pass very
slowly on their way from the green-room to the stage,
and pause at each of the three pine trees stationed
along it. A curtain shuts the end of the gallery from
the green-room. All the woodwork is unpainted and
unstained, though very highly polished, and there is
neither scenery nor appliances to break the harmony.
The three actual pine trees and a flat painted pine on
the wall at the back of the stage are all the ornament
there is.” The wood-cut facing p. <a href="#Page_12">10</a> is an illustration
of this stage taken from a Japanese print. It
represents an “undress” recital, but shows well the
build of the stage itself. The pine tree which is painted
on the bare boards at the back is not realistic, but is
much conventionalised, with solid emerald green masses
of foliage and a twisted trunk. It is like those trees
which are seen in symbolic pictures and on ancient
ceremonial embroideries such as are used at weddings
and at the New Year time. The pine tree, and all it has
come to mean to the Japanese as a symbol, is closely
associated with the <i>Nō</i>. Deeply interwoven in the
national sentiment is the play <i>Takasago</i>, which is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
story of the faithful spirits of the pine tree and is perhaps
the most important and most beloved of all
the <i>Nō</i>.</p>

<h3>The Chorus</h3>

<p>Quoting again from my paper: “Before the play
begins the chorus comes in, robed in blue or blue-grey,
and enters into the colour scheme. The men squat on
their heels with their legs folded straight and flat along
the boards on the right of the stage, and before them
lie their fans, which remain closed through the whole
play, but are raised upright while they are singing.
The chorus chants at intervals throughout the piece,
sometimes informing the audience of the events supposed
to be taking place, or to have taken place, sometimes
moralising on the fate or feelings of the hero or
heroine, sometimes describing their emotions, sometimes
even instructing them. While they are doing
this their fans are raised upright, with one end touching
the ground, and are laid down again directly the
words are finished. The Japanese name for the chorus
is <i>ji</i>, a word meaning also ‘ground’&mdash;the ground
colour, as it were, on which the figures of the drama
are painted.” As is natural, such an arrangement of
chorus and stage recalls the Greek plays. The comparisons
and contrasts between this and the Greek,
which spring immediately to one’s mind, have already
been published by Prof. Chamberlain and others, who
have given some account of the <i>Nō</i>, and to whose
works reference should be made (see list on p. <a href="#Page_103">103</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Music</h3>

<p>The music is an important feature of the <i>Nō</i> plays,
when they are completely presented. Indeed, the whole
play can be more fairly compared with opera than with
anything else on our stage, though the “singing” is
very different from ours. The songs are given with a
curious voice in which suppressed breathing is an item
of value. Other parts of the play are chanted in unison,
and even the prose “words” are intoned in a unique
way which removes them absolutely from the realm
of ordinary speaking, and makes them&mdash;to a foreigner&mdash;practically
indistinguishable from the songs. There
are, in addition to this vocal music, four instruments,
and the players of these are distinct from the chorus
and do not enter into its chanting at all, except sometimes
with a sudden sharp Ha! or something which I
confess I can only describe as being like the howl of a
cat, and which did not seem to me to add to the
impressiveness of the music, but to detract from it.</p>

<p>The musicians enter the theatre and take their place
on the stage, in the places indicated in the diagram, after
the chorus is seated and before the actors appear. In
a full set of musicians the first is the performer on the
<i>taiko</i>, who plays a flat drum set in a wooden stand on
the floor, ornamented with a gorgeous scarlet silk tassel
of such size and brilliance as to lend a vivid beauty to
the quiet colour scheme. The next musician is the
player of the <i>ōtsuzumi</i>, which is a kind of elongated
drum held on his knee. The <i>kotsuzumi</i> is an hour-glass-shaped
drum, which is held on the shoulder. Both
Profs. Chamberlain and Dickins call this a tambourine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
but that name gives an entirely wrong impression both
of the shape and the sound of this instrument. The
last musician plays the <i>fue</i> or flute.</p>

<p>Most Westerners are content to call this music “a
discord.” It is therefore pleasant to find Mr. Sansom
saying, “At times the flute strikes in with a long-drawn
note that has a strange and moving quality of sadness.”
Personally, with the exception of the single interjected
cries, the music appealed to me as being in complete
harmony with the pieces and as adding greatly to their
charm and meaning.</p>


<h3>The Actors</h3>

<p>The actors enter from behind the curtain at the end
of the gallery leading to the stage. They move towards
the stage one by one, and very slowly, with long intervals
between each step, every motion of which has been
decreed for centuries. Captain Brinkley says, “It is,
indeed, more than doubtful whether any other people
ever developed such an expressive vocabulary of motion,
such impressive eloquence of gesture. These masked
dancers of the <i>Nō</i>, deprived of the important assistance
of facial expression, and limited to a narrow range of
cadence, nevertheless succeeded in investing their performance
with a character of noble dignity and profound
intensity of sentiment.” The actors pause at each of
the pine trees which stand by the gallery to mark a
stage in their progress. Only men act, and for the
women’s parts they wear the conventional masks with
the white, narrow face and the eyebrows painted high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
up on the middle of the forehead, which is the classical
standard of female beauty. Masks are also worn by
those representing demons or ghosts, and these masks
are much on the same plan as those worn by children on
the fifth of November. They are made of carved wood
with a slit for the mouth and two holes for the eyes.
They are palpably masks put over the face and make no
pretence at verisimilitude; indeed, sometimes the girl’s
mask may be openly tied on with a fillet ribbon across
the forehead. They are clearly illustrated in the plates
facing pages <a href="#Page_14">15</a> and <a href="#Page_76">76</a>, where the white mask-face is
put so as to show quite frankly the tanned and corrugated
neck of the elderly actor. Wild bushy heads of
long hair are also worn by those taking the part of
demons, and sometimes by the ghosts, as is seen in
the plate facing p. <a href="#Page_76">76</a>, where the little figure represents
the ghost in the <i>Sumidagawa</i>.</p>

<p class="center">A COUNTRY POETESS</p>

<p><i>The figure of a country girl, who was also a poetess,
and sent a subtle verse in reply to a noble who sought to
obtain some of the plant growing by her cottage (as represented
on the stage by the bower to the left of the cut.)
The figure shows well the ceremonial dress, of scarlet
<span class="plainfont">hakama</span>, or divided skirt, with flowing, voluminous
<span class="plainfont">kimono</span> over it. At the throat can be seen the series of
under-dresses, of which only the edge of each appears.
The massive folds over the head are not some head-dress,
as might at first be thought, but the folds of the long
kimono sleeve falling back over the arm which is raised
above the head. The squatting figure to the right is that
of a priest, who comes into the story of this <span class="plainfont">Nō</span>.</i>
</p></div>
</div>


<h3>The Costumes</h3>

<p>Though in other respects the <i>Nō</i> staging is so simply
organised, the costumes of the actors are sumptuous
and completely representative of the parts the actors
are playing. The various robes are all of mediæval cut
and fashion, and are mostly very stiff with opulent
brocades or embroideries. Some of the styles are shown
in the various illustrations in this book, and it will at
once be noticed that they are all elaborate and richly
coloured. While the cut of most of the garments is
something akin to the simple <i>kimono</i> and <i>hakama</i>
(divided skirt worn by the men when fully dressed) of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the present day, they are on a more massive scale with
great stiff boufflé divided skirts (as the figure in plate
3, p. <a href="#Page_15">14</a>, shows particularly well), and with the kimono
sleeves so wide and stiff that the wearer seems almost
three times his normal width. The figure on the
<a href="#Page_ii">Frontispiece</a> illustrates such excessively voluminous and
elaborate dress. The garments may be worn in overlaid
series, showing beneath a rich overdress the edges of
many equally fine under-robes, and of course armour
and accoutrements are carried by those representing the
ancient warriors.</p>

<p>The costumes of the <i>Nō</i> are in truth the treasures of
a museum, put to actual use.</p>


<h3>Properties</h3>

<p>There are few or no “stage properties” of any kind.
Just as there is no scenery and the images of the places
in which the action lies must be evolved in their own
minds by the spectators, guided by the descriptive
passages of the play; so also there are no appliances.
If the actors, for instance, have to enter a boat and be
rowed across a stream, they will perhaps merely step
over a bamboo pole. If one of the characters has to
ladle up water and offer it to a fainting warrior, the
whole action is accomplished with a fan. Sometimes
there may be a little in the way of properties&mdash;for
example, the arbour-like bowers in plate 3, p. <a href="#Page_15">14</a>,
which are drawn on to the stage and represent dwellings,
and in plate 4, p. <a href="#Page_17">16</a>, where the little temple bell is
brought into the action. But even in such cases the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
actors have to create an illusion round the accessories
by their words and motions.</p>

<p>We scarcely need to be reminded that Shakespeare’s
plays were originally written for a stage which had but
little more in the way of properties, and that even
to-day there are not a few persons who feel that Shakespeare’s
finest passages do not gain but actually lose by
the life-like and elaborate settings of the modern stage.</p>

<p>When one hears the <i>Nō</i> called archaic and primitive
because of their absence of scenery and the child-like
simplicity and artlessness of the properties one feels it
is by a critic who is confusing values. “Words which
unaided can hold an audience, a drama which can paint
the scene directly on the mind with little intervention
of the eye, is surely not rightly described as primitive.”</p>

<p class="center">MIIDERA</p>

<p><i>This print, taken from a Japanese coloured woodcut,
illustrates the central figure of a <span class="plainfont">Nō</span> drama, with the
single, most characteristic piece of stage “property,” belonging
to the play. The figure is that of a mother, well-nigh
mad with grief at the loss of her child, (note the
bamboo in her hand, a symbol of her state) who sets out
to seek him. She finds the little one at the Temple of
Miidera, a view of which is inset in the black circle on the
left of the print. The model of a temple bell in red lacquer
beneath this is mounted on roller feet, and is an illustration
of the piece of property which is all that represents
the temple on the stage, and is a good example of the
simplicity of the stage-mounting of the <span class="plainfont">Nō</span> pieces.</i>
</p></div>
</div>


<h3>The Audience</h3>

<p>Prof. Aston, in his <i>History of Japanese Literature</i>,
says (p. 200): “Representations (of the <i>Nō</i>) are still
given in Tokio, Kioto and other places, by the descendants
or successors of the old managers who founded the
art ... and are attended by small but select audiences
composed almost entirely of ex-Daimios or military
nobles and their ex-retainers. To the vulgar the <i>Nō</i> are
completely unintelligible.” The contrast between the
audiences at the <i>Nō</i> and at the common theatre is very
marked, but then it must be remembered that practically
no one of culture or refinement attends the common
theatre, and practically every one of that class is interested
in the <i>Nō</i>. Owing to the present social con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>ditions
in Japan, however, the audiences at the <i>Nō</i>
pieces are not so small or so restricted as this would
lead us to believe if we did not remember that ex-daimios
and military nobles have entered almost every
social grade; many, indeed most, of the common police
are Samurai, excessively poor students of the University
or school teachers, and even rickshaw-men may be the
representatives of the proud old families. When, a
little more than forty years ago, the great social upheaval
and re-organisation of Japan took place, and the nobles
and Samurai lost their privileged positions, though
they were given positions of honourable standing so
far as possible, many of them entered the ranks of what
we would call the “common people”; and so it happens
that to-day there are permeating nearly the whole of
society, in all its grades, some of the old cultured class.
Among policemen, rickshaw-men and gardeners one
may come across men of deep classical interests and
knowledge, and a poor student living on a few shillings
a week may spend his evenings chanting the <i>Nō</i> songs
to the moon. Indeed, while I was in Tokio such a
one lived near the house in which I dwelt for a few
months. I never met him personally, because I did
not wish to destroy the wonderful impression of
melancholy romance and weird beauty which his chanting
gave me. The many evenings that I sat alone on
my balcony, looking toward Fuji mountain, behind
which the sun had set, and heard in the swiftly passing
twilight and under the glittering oriental stars the
mournful, tragic chants of the <i>Nō</i> which this young
man was practising, have left their life-long impression
on me, and perhaps account for the deeper love and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
understanding of the <i>Nō</i> which have come to me than
to the foreigners who hear only a few performances in
a theatre. Yet this young man lived in what could
scarcely be called more than a hovel, and he is representative
of thousands now so living in Japan.</p>

<p>Consequently one must remember that though the
audience of a <i>Nō</i> theatre is “select” in the real sense,
it is not by any means entirely composed of wealthy
folk.</p>

<p>All who can afford to do so come in full ceremonial
dress, which is sombre-coloured both for men and
women, for custom only allows the brilliant colours to
be donned by children and young girls. Most of the
audience arrives by nine o’clock in the morning, and
remains till three or four in the afternoon. The
“boxes” are little matted compartments marked off
on the floor, with railings round them but six inches
high, and every one sits on his folded-up legs on a
cushion on the floor. As will be seen in the diagram
(p. <a href="#Page_12">10</a>) the audience sits round three sides of the stage.
In the winter they will have a little charcoal fire in the
box beside them, and will sit warming their hands over
it as they watch the piece.</p>


<h3>Concerning the Effect of the <i>Nō</i> on
the Audience and on me</h3>

<p>In a common theatre the audience talks, eats, and even
plays games between the scenes of the play, and gives
its best attention during a murder or a very realistic
hara-kiri, when the blood trickles in lifelike fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
out of the actor’s mouth as he writhes for half-an-hour
in his death agonies with a crimson gash across his
middle. I shall never forget a scene of the kind which
nearly did for me altogether, but which stirred the whole
audience to breathless attention. During a performance
of the <i>Nō</i>, on the other hand, most of the audience
listen absorbedly to the whole piece, many being well
able to check or criticise the actor if he should make the
slightest slip, as they are personally acquainted with the
parts. Others follow the chanting with a book of the
text in their hands, and thus secure themselves against
losing a word; for the <i>Nō</i> is like our own opera in this,
that unless one is well acquainted with the words of
the piece they are apt to be lost here and there. Each
one of the audience has some knowledge of classical
poetry, and according to the degree of this knowledge
is the enjoyment of the thousand allusions and part
quotations and adaptations that are in the plays. With
each recognised reference to some classic poem or story,
the richer does the suggestion of the whole become, for
a word or a phrase which has but little meaning in itself
becomes fragrant and beautiful when it carries with it
the perfume of a thousand lovely and suggestive
memories. Also working upon the sensitive audience
all the time, there is the psychic effect of the beautiful
and harmonious colouring and of the potent music.
The psychological effect of music is a power which we
all vaguely recognise, but few of us begin to understand.
Nevertheless, I hold it as certain that for the
time being it physically as well as spiritually affects us,
and that when we are tuned to the throb and rhythm
of fundamentally great and <i>right</i> music, though we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
no nearer to an intellectual understanding of the root
things of the universe, yet we are actually nearer a
spiritual oneness with, and hence a sort of comprehension
of them. The music of the <i>Nō</i>, founded on a
different scale from our own, has a very peculiar effect,
yet one in complete harmony with the mental conceptions
of the plays.</p>

<p>And to this effect the audience of the <i>Nō</i> is pre-eminently
exposed, for all the surrounding conditions
are calculated to enhance and aid it: the magnetic effect
of the quiet, intellectual audience on itself; the beautiful
simplicity and harmony of the colour scheme within
the theatre; the dignity and impersonalness of the actors
fulfilling their anciently prescribed actions; the allusions
and suggestions of the poems, the descriptions of natural
beauties and the frequent references to religious and
philosophical ideas; when combined with the strange
and solemn music of the singers create together within
the heart of the observer a something which is well nigh
sublime.</p>

<p>Going to the <i>Nō</i> as a stranger and a foreigner, to
whom almost all the allusions and suggestions of
classical quotation were lost&mdash;to whom no thrills could
be communicated by the mention of a single word (just
think for a moment what feelings the one name <i>Deirdre
of the Sorrows</i> creates in you if you know the Irish
stories and have seen Synge’s play. Well, just such
feelings are created in a Japanese by single words and
names, which to us appear prosy or unintelligible), yet
even I was caught in the power of the whole creation of
the <i>Nō</i>. To my earlier words I still adhere: “There
is in the whole a ring of fire and splendour, of pain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
pathos, which none but a cultured Japanese can fully
appreciate, but which we Westerners might hear, though
the sounds be muffled, if we would only incline our
ears.” Those who find the <i>Nō</i> plays prosy and of
mediocre merit, have but partially comprehended them
through having been too intent upon the “letter of
the law.”</p>


<h3>Concerning the dramatic Construction
of the <i>Nō</i></h3>

<p>True “dramatic” qualities are almost entirely absent
from the <i>Nō</i>; there is no interplay of the characters, no
working up of a story to some moving, dramatic and
apparently inevitable conclusion. Nor are the unities
of time and place in the least regarded. Even centuries
may be supposed to elapse in the course of the story of
a play, and an actor may be represented as travelling
far while declaiming a short speech. An outline scheme
of the plot which would be found to fit the majority
of the plays is as follows: The hero or heroine, or the
secondary character, sets out upon a journey, generally
in search of some person or to fulfil some duty or
religious object, and on this journey passes some famous
spot. In the course of long and generally wearying
wanderings, a recital of which gives an opportunity for
the descriptions of natural beauties, this living person
meets some god, or the ghost or re-incarnated spirit of
some person of note, or perhaps the altered and melancholy
wreck of some one of former grand estate.
Generally at first this ghost or spirit is not recognised,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and the living hero converses with it about the legends
or histories attached to the locality. Usually then
toward the end the ghost makes itself known as the
spirit of the departed hero for which the spot is famous.
Often a priest forms one of the characters, and then the
ghost may be soothed by his prayers and exhortations.
There is generally some moral teaching interwoven with
the story, the hero or the ghost exemplifying filial or
paternal duty, patriotism, or some such quality; while
there is a thread of Buddhistic teaching throughout.
In this the main theme is the transitoriness of human
life, and at the same time is presented a view of all
the pain and misery people may endure when they are
not rendered superior to it by a recognition of the
higher philosophy that teaches that the whole universe
is a dream, from whose toils the freed spirit can escape.</p>

<p>The primitive complement of actors was probably
two, but few plays have so small a number. Three or
perhaps four actors is the usual, and six, with a few
exceptions, is the highest number for a complete
cast.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The hero or protagonist is called the <i>shite</i>.</p>

<p>2. The companion or assistant to the hero is the <i>tsure</i>.</p>

<p>3. The balance of the story is preserved by a sort of
deuteragonist called the <i>waki</i>, who may also have
his <i>tsure</i>.</p>

<p>4. A child part may be added to enrich or add pathos
to the play (as in the <i>Sumida River</i> for example),
and he is called the <i>kokata</i>.</p>

<p>5. Then there may be the <i>ahi</i>, or supplementary actor.</p></div>

<p>The actors do not perform many evolutions on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
stage, and though their movements are in harmony with
the story to some extent, they tend to remain more or
less in the relative positions that are indicated on the
plan of the stage facing p. <a href="#Page_12">10</a>.</p>


<h3>Concerning the literary Style of the
original texts of the <i>Nō</i></h3>

<p>The text of the <i>Nō</i> is composed of a mixture of somewhat
stilted and archaic prose, incompletely phrased
portions, and poetry in correct metrical form. The
strictly compressed and regulated five and seven
syllabled lines of the short, standard verses of Japan
are here scattered somewhat irregularly. Indeed, the
general text of the <i>Nō</i> may perhaps best be described
as poetry but half dissolved in prose; or, to use another
simile, as an archipelago of little islets of poetry in a
sea of prose, each islet surrounded and connected by
sandy shores and bars which have been reduced almost
to sea level.</p>

<p>All through the pieces there is an immense number
of plays upon words, of “pillow” and “pivot” words,
of short quotations from and allusions to classical poetry,
so that the text simply bristles with opportunities for
literary “commentators.” The excessive amount of
classical allusion and quotation, while it does not appeal
at all to us, is one of the features which principally
delights the Japanese literati. For this is considered not
only to show the degree of knowledge which the author
possessed, but also to add greatly to the richness and
suggestiveness of the piece by bringing to the memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
other cognate scenes and ideas. The merit of the
frequent quotations being that they allow of great compression
and terseness of style, so that in a few words
an author can bring a series of scenes before the mind
of his audience.</p>

<p class="center">SŌSHIARI-GOMACHI</p>

<p><i>This plate, taken from a Japanese coloured woodcut,
illustrates the <span class="plainfont">Nō</span> of which Komachi is the heroine. She
was a poetess of great beauty and poetic gifts, and many
distinguished poets were very jealous of her. On the
occasion of one of the competitions of verse before the
Emperor (the figure on the extreme right with scarlet
skirts) one of her enemies attempted to prove that her
verse was plagiarized and that he had it already in his
own collection. She proves his fraud by washing out the
verse which he had just written into his book after hearing
it, showing that it was not printed with the rest. This
she is about to do in the picture. The story continues
that after his exposure he tried to commit suicide to
escape disgrace, but she generously prevented him. The
mask worn by the actor who takes her part well illustrates
the classic type of beauty in Japan. The eyebrows are
shaved off, and painted on high upon the forehead beneath
the hair. In the action she uses a fan to express the
business of washing out the interpolated verses <span class="plainfont">(see p. <a href="#Page_16">16</a>)</span>.
The oblong article to the right represents the table on
which a copy of her verses was laid in the competition.</i>
</p></div>
</div>

<p>So much we can understand, but the “pillow” and
“pivot” words are without parallel in our own
language. By means of them the subject may be
diverted to some idea which appears, to our way of
thinking, totally unconnected. For instance, in the
<i>Sumida River</i> (see p. <a href="#Page_83">83</a>) the use of the root word
for <i>repute</i> by the Ferryman makes the Mother, in the
following line, recall and quote a classic poem on quite
another subject which has the same root word in it. The
link connecting the two subjects being merely the one
root word which is common to both, and which is called
the pivot word, the value of which is, of course,
entirely lost in translation. In English, unconnected
ideas alone are left. Some examples of such devices
are mentioned in the notes following the translations
of the plays at the end of the book, but throughout the
<i>utai</i> they are of perpetual recurrence and are far too
frequent to be mentioned every time they appear. In
his <i>Classical Poetry of the Japanese</i>, Prof. Chamberlain
gives an account of the pivot words, and he admires
their “dissolving view” effects, but Aston thinks them
frivolous and a sign of decadence. These “pivot
words” as well as the “pillow words,” though they
are so prevalent in its literature, are not at all confined
to the <i>utai</i> of the <i>Nō</i>, but are characteristic of the whole
of the early Japanese verse. The “pillow words”
(called <i>makura-kotoba</i> in Japanese) have been collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
by Prof. F. F. V. Dickins<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> recently, and he says, “The
<i>makura-kotoba</i> form the characteristic embellishment of
the early <i>uta</i> of Japan, and of all subsequent Japanese,
as distinguished from Japano-Chinese verse.”</p>

<p>As regards rhyme, there is no use of such rhyming
as characterises our own verse; and this may partly
depend on the structure of the Japanese language.
Japanese words are not composed of letters as they are
with us, but of syllables; every consonant is associated
with all the vowels. Thus the words are compounded
of a larger number of elements than with us, but each
ends in one of the five vowels or in <i>n</i>. The elements
are <i>ka</i>, <i>ki</i>, <i>ko</i>, <i>ta</i>, <i>ti</i>, <i>tu</i>, <i>te</i>, <i>to</i>, and so on. This will at
once be evident if we examine a few words of romanised
Japanese. For example, the first line of the play
<i>Tamura</i> is <i>Hina no myakoji hedate kite</i>.</p>

<p>In the <i>utai</i>, though there is no terminal rhyming,
there is sometimes a tendency to repeat the same
syllable more than once in a phrase, with the deliberate
intention of accentuating it.</p>


<h3>Concerning the Difficulties of Translation</h3>

<p>Only half-a-dozen of the complete <i>Nō</i> and portions of a
few others have been translated into English from all the
many Japanese originals that are available. But this is
scarcely surprising. In translating any of the <i>Nō</i> there
are two supreme difficulties to be encountered. The
first depends on the organic remoteness of the Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
language from our own, which is common to any translation
from the Japanese; and the second is the peculiar
difficulty of translating the <i>utai</i> because the exact meaning
of many portions of them is disputed even by
Japanese authorities, and then even where the meaning
may be clear to a Japanese expert the compression of
the language is so great that it cannot literally be
rendered into a European language. From a French or
German, even from a Russian original, a literal translation
is comprehensible even if it is not beautiful in
English. A literal English translation from a Japanese
original is arrant nonsense. The Japanese language is
not merely unlike ours; the whole mode and order of
the thought upon which it is founded is on an entirely
different plan from our own. The more conscientious
the translator the greater his difficulty. It is easy
enough to translate “<i>O yasumi nasai</i>” as “good-night,”
but how are we to say in English what it really
means, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> approximately “honourably deign to take
rest,” without appearing remote and stilted? And that
is just a simple little common phrase; when the Japanese
to be translated is contorted and coruscated with “pillow
words” and “pivot words,” with a phrase from an old
classical poem of which the reader is supposed to know
the whole, and cannot “see the point” unless he does
so, what is the translator to do? But suppose, further,
that a couple of the words are the subject of learned
controversy, as is frequently the case, is it likely two
translations will coincide?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>


<h3>Concerning the Translations of others,
as well as those in this Book</h3>

<p>There are three principal lines that a much-to-be-pitied
translator may take. (1) He may give up in despair
any attempt at being literal. He belongs, let us say,
to the school that think it best to translate “<i>O yasumi
nasai</i>” as “good-night.” He has this pre-eminent
virtue that he will give us at least a version which can
be read as English. And there is much to be said for
this mode of treatment. (2) On the other hand, a great
contrast to translator No. 1 is he who desires to give a
literal version of the Japanese, and who does not care
in the least whether it sounds smooth and finished in
English. (3) Then there is the last, and perhaps the
most misguided of all, who cares a great deal to convey
the true Japanese impression and also tries to polish
and round off the English so that it may not appear too
stilted or too rough, but may convey to the English
reader something of the true spirit of the Japanese
without always diverting his attention to some peculiarity
of the rendering’s bodily form. As I myself have
endeavoured to supply the third type of translations,
I may be allowed to enlarge a little on the attitude of
mind of one making the attempt.</p>

<p>M. Bergson, in his inimitable book on laughter,
says, “Where lies the comic element in this sentence,
taken from a funeral speech and quoted by a German
philosopher: ‘He was virtuous, and plump’? It lies
in the fact that our attention is suddenly recalled from
the soul to the body.” The sudden intrusion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
body, particularly the imperfect or ill-managed body, is
the source of most of the comic element in human life.</p>

<p>Hence, recognising this fatal pitfall, I have felt it
essential to make the <i>body</i> of my translations as little
irritating and noticeable as possible, while at the same
time preserving, as far as the language will allow, complete
truthfulness to the spirit of the original. All my
sympathies are with the translators in class No. 2, and
were our universe not organised in the humorous way
that M. Bergson has pointed out, I should have ranked
myself with them, and attempted to give only a literal
rendering of the Japanese. But such translations never
allow us for a moment to forget the English body of
the original Japanese spirit, because the body they give
it is out of joint, abnormal in our eyes, and therefore it
absorbs our attention or renders ridiculous the hints it
conveys that the spirit it encloses may have aspired to soar.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate by quotation&mdash;</p>

<p>Dickins’s<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> most scholarly and valuable translation
keeps one’s attention always in the realm of intellectual
interest, and it is his intention to be strictly in accord
with the original. His version is partly in prose and
partly in this form&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">“across the surf he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">upon the shipway oareth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">gentle the skies are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">the spring-winds softly blowing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">what tale of days shall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">his bark in the cloudy distance<br /></span>
<span class="i2">sail o’er the sea-plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">till Hāruma he reacheth.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>With this it is interesting to compare Aston’s translation,
which is largely prose. The lines quoted above
from Dickins are rendered by Aston<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> as follows: “With
waves that rise along the shore, and a genial wind of
spring upon the ship-path, how many days pass without
a trace of him we know not, until at length he has
reached the longed-for bay of Takasago, on the coast
of Harima.”</p>

<p>This play of <i>Takasago</i> is often quoted and is much
beloved by the Japanese, and some of the verses from
it are invariably chanted at the wedding festivals. The
beginning of the famous chorus is thus rendered by
Aston (p. 209)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“On the four seas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still are the waves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world is at peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft blow the time-winds,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rustling not the branches.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such an age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blest are the very firs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that they meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To grow old together.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Captain Brinkley’s translation of <i>Ataka</i> is in somewhat
similar style to the preceding, a mixture of
prose and “verse” of short lines like the following
example&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“From traveller’s vestment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pendent bells ring notes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pilgrims’ foot-falls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from road-stained sleeves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pendent dew-drops presage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears of last meetings.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>To the same school of translators belongs Mr. Sansom,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
though he is slightly less literal than Mr. Dickins.
He renders the exquisite fragment from the <i>Sakuragawa</i>
as follows&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The waters flow, the flowers fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">forever lasts the Spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon shines cold, the wind blows high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">the cranes do not fly home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flowers that grow in the rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">are scarlet, and light up the stream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trees that grow by the caverns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">are green and contain the breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blossoms open like brocade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">the brimming pools are deep and blue.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All the time we are reading this the magic of suggestion
is working, and we would fain let our minds
float away into the land of spring; but our attention is
brought plumping down to the bodily presentation of
the thoughts and our intellect is set at work to see how
the lines might have been made to scan, or to run in
some form of rhythm. So long as they do just scan and
have a passable rhythm, we do not think of the poetical
qualities of the translation, but when they jolt us along
our attention is constantly diverted from the higher
theme to the lesser subject of English grammar and
versification.</p>

<p>So that I have endeavoured in my translations to make
the lines run smoothly enough to be read aloud without
much irritation; and though I have doubtless not fully
succeeded, I have tried to give them as much verbal
beauty as was possible within the narrow limits afforded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
me by the literal Japanese meaning. In this my collaborator,
Prof. Sakurai, has held the rein on me at times
when I would have liked to run away with some poetical
conceits, and it is owing entirely to his tireless exertions
that the result has a fair degree of accuracy. I must
relieve him of too great a responsibility, however, for I
confess that here and there where it seemed to me imperative
to put in a word or two more than was in the
original in order to convey the necessary impression to
an English reader, or where several lines of metre would
have been upset if he wouldn’t let me have the word I
wanted, I have just taken the bit between my teeth and
run away from him. But this has happened seldom, and
on the whole I think it will be found that the English
version bears close comparison with the Japanese.</p>

<p>Now a word regarding the type of verse that is used
by those who translate into a recognisable English form.
Of these the translations in Prof. Chamberlain’s <i>Classical
Poetry of the Japanese</i> of four of the finest and most
renowned <i>utai</i> of the <i>Nō</i> are models to be considered by
any later translator. Prof. Chamberlain puts the “words”
into prose, and the “songs” into rhymed verse.</p>

<p>The chorus at the end of the <i>Robe of Feathers</i> is a
good example of this easily flowing verse (p. 146)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Dance on, sweet maiden, through the happy hours!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dance on, sweet maiden, while the magic flow’rs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowning thy tresses flutter in the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rais’d by thy waving pinions intertwin’d!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dance on! for ne’er to mortal dance ’tis giv’n<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To vie with that sweet dance thou bring’st from heav’n:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when, cloud-soaring, thou shalt all too soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Homeward return to the full-shining moon,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then hear our pray’rs, and from thy bounteous hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pour sev’nfold treasures on our happy land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bless ev’ry coast, refresh each panting field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That earth may still her proper increase yield!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But to my ear such consistently rhymed verse does not
convey any suggestion of the sound of the Japanese
chants. As Captain Brinkley has it, “by obeying the
exigencies of rhyme, whereas the original demands
rhythm only (‘the learned sinologues, their translators’),
have obtained elegance at the partial expense of fidelity.”
It is true that a less formal versifying, such as I have
used, does not represent truly the Japanese effect either&mdash;nothing
can; but it seems less out of harmony with
its character than do the rhyming stanzas. Then also
I found that short rhymed lines render one liable to
strain the sense a little in order to make things fit in.
Longer lines, without such regular rhyming, allow one
more play, and this enables one to follow the words
suggested directly by the Japanese. Since then also
Prof. Chamberlain’s own taste has changed and he has
“gone over to the camp of the literalists.”</p>

<p>In two of the pieces I have put the “words” into
a longer metre to indicate the difference between them
and the “songs.” But I find this makes an added
difficulty for any one reading aloud, without much
enhancing the accuracy of the whole, so that in <i>Kagekiyo</i>
I have made no distinction between the various
parts of the text. In listening to a Japanese <i>Nō</i> performance
one could not really tell where the “words”
left off and the “songs” began, and also, as I have
previously noted (p. <a href="#Page_24">24</a>), the poems are connected to
the prose by irregularly dispersed poetical lines. Finally,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>


<h3>In Conclusion</h3>

<p>as none of the prose in the least corresponds to our prose,
and as it is not given in the ordinary speaking voice of
the Japanese, but is always specially intoned, it seems
to me much more suitable and harmonious to render the
whole <i>utai</i> in verse of various kinds.</p>

<p>Even this little book has been the task of years, despite
its many imperfections. It was undertaken primarily
because I delighted in the <i>Nō</i>, and the labour of bringing
it through the Press was rendered lighter by the
hope that it might give pleasure to the English reading
public to see, even “through a glass darkly,” something
of the beauty of this unexplored literature. I have
already described the effect these plays have on the
Japanese and on me. That I have caught perhaps an
echo of their spirit I am encouraged to think, because
on the two occasions when one or other of these translations
have been read to audiences it has been reported to
me that several of those who heard them were in tears.
That strikes the right note. For with all their literary
richness and their descriptions of beautiful scenes and
of heroic deeds, the ground note of the <i>Nō</i> is human
tragedy. Their tragedy is of the fundamental, elemental
kind that depends upon the very nature of our

<h3>Authorship of the Play</h3>

<p>This piece is now commonly attributed to <i>Kiyotsugu</i>,
and is supposed to have been produced at the end of
the fourteenth century. Its exact date is not known,
but Kiyotsugu was born in 1354 and died in 1406; yet
it is most likely that he was an adapter and not the
original author of the <i>utai</i>, parts of which were probably
written long before his time. The play is still one of
the most important of the <i>Nō</i>, and is indeed a test piece,
as parts of the <i>Shite’s</i> chanting are exceptionally difficult.
A foreigner cannot judge of this, but from my own
point of view it is perhaps the finest of all the <i>Nō</i>.</p>


<h3>Outline of the Story</h3>

<p>The play is based on a story told&mdash;or rather written
down, for it was probably told long before then&mdash;a
thousand years ago in the <i>Yamato Monogatari</i>, or <i>Tales
of Japan</i>. It is the story of the love of two men for
one woman, and the fatal consequences thereof for all
concerned.</p>

<p>UNAI, a maiden living near Ikuta, was loved by
two equally gifted men. On the selfsame day they
each sent her a letter declaring their passion, but she
could not decide between them, fearing the anger of
either rejected suitor. Her father determined that the
one who shot most accurately should win her, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the contest the two men pierced the same wing of the
same bird with their arrows. This bird was a mandarin
duck, a creature whose lifelong faithfulness to its mate
was proverbial in Japan. The girl felt bitterly that
she was to blame for the death of the bird and the
misery its mate endured, as well as for the strife between
the two men. Hence she drowned herself. Then the
two men, visiting her tomb, were filled with remorse,
and killed each other beside her grave. This, however,
only added to the girl’s guilt, and much of the play
is taken up with vivid descriptions of her agonising
torments in the eight hells believed in by popular
Buddhism.</p>

<p>The play opens with a traveller Priest passing the
village of Ikuta on his way to the capital. It is early
spring, and the village maidens are out gathering the
first green shoots of the “seven herbs,” which used
to be eaten at the beginning of the year as a kind of
ceremony. The city folk make this herb-gathering a
pleasure picnic, but the poor girls going out of necessity
into the biting cold of January are envious of those who
are better off in cities. The spirit of the long dead
UNAI has joined them in the form of a young girl,
but she takes part in the opening dialogue. The
“Maiden’s (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> UNAI’S) Tomb” is one of the famous
places in the district, and the Priest asks to see it.
UNAI’S spirit remains behind when the village girls
have been driven home by the cold, and she conducts
the Priest to the tomb, conversing with him, and telling
him the story of UNAI. Her spirit’s materialisation
as a maiden then vanishes, and UNAI appears as a
Ghost, for whom the Priest prays. The Ghost laments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
over the tomb, and the Chorus gives expression to her
longing for the human world. The Ghost expresses
her thankfulness for the prayer uttered by the Priest,
and recounts her agonising sufferings in the eight hells.
The Priest makes some effort, but not a very determined
one, to inculcate in the poor Ghost the higher Buddhistic
belief that all these things, even the hells, are delusions,
and her mind could free herself of them. The play
closes with the Chorus telling of her miseries in hell.</p>


<h3>Comments on the Play</h3>

<p>In its construction, and its presentment of the story as
a whole, this play resembles strikingly one of the
beautiful tryptic colour prints of Japan, in which an
exquisite, softly coloured garden or woodland foreground,
shaded with delicate mists, brings into intense
relief the vivid figure of an armoured warrior going
out to battle. In the opening passages of this play we
have the soft, misted foreground, with the tender green
shoots of the early spring-time. One sees the thin,
frosted ice pushing aside the sprouting plants, and the
scene is enhanced and the description of it embroidered
by poetic references to the details of the picture. But
among the maidens is one, outwardly like others, so
that they do not recognise the difference themselves,
but yet one who is a tragic figure, a temporary reincarnation
of a spirit from hell. Then with the Priest the
spirit converses, and paints in vivid colours this central
figure, for whom the whole scene forms but the setting.</p>

<p>To us in the West the moral attitude of the play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
seems very strange. From her initial ‘sin’ in being
sufficiently beautiful to attract the love of two men,
and her guilt in causing the death of the mandarin
duck (in a Buddhistic country no small crime), we see
crime after crime laid upon the maiden’s head. And
all the time in our eyes she appears utterly innocent of
everything save a too ready yielding to a tender conscience,
and a willingness to take blame upon herself.
Hapless maiden, how different is this treatment of hers
from that accorded in the West to charming girls. In
Old Japan not all the eight hells would have been
accounted sufficient for Helen of Troy.</p>

<p>In its religious attitude we see the popular beliefs
of Buddhism contrasted with the higher form of the
same religion. The circumstantial details of the hells
and punishments were believed in by the common folk,
but as the Priest says (on p. <a href="#Page_49">49</a>) all was delusion, both
in the world and in heaven or hell, and the soul could
escape from its torments by a recognition of this higher
fact.</p>

<h3>Authorship of the Play</h3>

<p>This Play was probably written about 1410; at any
rate in the first quarter of the fifteenth century. Its
author was <i>Motokiyo</i>, who was born in 1374 and who
died in 1455. He was the eldest son of the famous
Kiyotsugu (see p. <a href="#Page_7">7</a>).</p>


<h3>Outline of the Story</h3>

<p>The time of the action of the play is about the year
1190, and Kagekiyo, the hero of the story, is a very
renowned warrior of the Taira clan. The Taira and
the Minamoto (Gen) clans were rivals and were perpetually
at war; during the years 1156-1185 more
particularly this struggle culminated, when Japan had
her “Wars of the Roses.”</p>

<p>Kagekiyo, known as the Boisterous, owing to his
uneven temper and ready appeals to arms, was a famous
warrior of the Taira clan, and when the Minamoto
Shōgunate was established at Kamakura, Kagekiyo was
exiled to a distant place in Hiuga, where he became
blind and passed a miserable existence as a beggar. He
had a daughter called Hitomaru, whom he left in Kamakura
in the charge of a lady. At the time of the play,
Hitomaru has just grown up to be a young lady, but
she had a great desire to meet her father, and so set out
with a servant to seek him. She has a long and arduous
journey to the place of her father’s exile, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
enduring considerable hardships she at last finds Kagekiyo’s
retreat. She and her servant encounter a villager
who assists them in the final search for Kagekiyo, and
they make inquiries of a blind beggar dwelling in a
miserable straw hut. This beggar is actually Kagekiyo,
but at first he refuses to answer them or to acknowledge
it, out of shame and consideration for his daughter.
Ultimately, however, he recounts to her some of his
adventures, and then he commands her to leave him
and they part for ever.</p>


<h3>Comments on the Play</h3>

<p>In this play there is perhaps less description of the
beauties of Nature than in many of the <i>Nō</i>, but the
opening lines are particularly fraught with the meaning
which permeates the whole play.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The dew remains until the wind doth blow.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The comparison of human life to a drop of dew is
one frequently made in the literature of the <i>Nō</i>.
Throughout this play there are many phrases showing
how deeply the characters feel the transitoriness of
human life. After Hitomaru’s longing for a place to
rest a little while, Kagekiyo exclaims&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nay, in the three worlds there is not a place.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Kagekiyo’s behaviour to his child, and his reception
of her after her long search for him, appears to us to
be most cruel; but it is, nevertheless, based on the conceptions
of the chivalry of his time. Kagekiyo’s leading
thought was the really unselfish desire to keep the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
shame of his condition from touching his daughter.
His first wish is that she shall not even recognise or
speak with him; but when this is frustrated, he commands
both the servant and the villager to send her
back immediately their short meeting is over. And yet
he does not seek even a moment’s embrace, nor does
he use an endearing phrase to his daughter. The play
is a good illustration of the way that the old codes of
Japanese chivalry imposed courses of action which seem
now in this softer age well-nigh inhuman in their
repression and conquest of the natural feelings.</p>

<h3>DRAMATIS PERSONÆ</h3>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Shite</i>: The Spirit of TAMURAMARU, a renowned warrior, in the
first part appearing as a youth, and in the second as a warrior.</p>

<p><i>Waki</i>: A Travelling Priest.</p>

<p><i>Chorus.</i></p></div>


<p>SCENE</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The temple ground of Kiyomizu in Kioto, in March. The shrine
of Tamuramaru is erected in this ground.</p></div>

<p>There are only two actors in this piece, and it is even
less dramatic than the preceding. As it does not lend
itself so well to complete translation, I shall give the
piece merely as a <i>résumé</i>, with a few of the more
beautiful lines rendered <i>in extenso</i>. This drama is an
admirable example of the use of a delicately toned,
flower-like foreground, as a setting for the warlike
figure who recites tales of his strenuous life, which is
so characteristic of the construction of the <i>Nō</i>.</p>



<p class="tb">The PRIEST enters first, and, as is often the case
at the beginning of a <i>Nō</i>, he recites an account of his
hurried journey in the spring, past the provincial
capitals to the “nine-fold capital of the Emperor”
(Kioto). He speaks of the mild sky of the spring
with the sun shrouded by soft haze, and announces
that he has now arrived at the Temple of Kiyomizu
(meaning clear water) with its peaceful waterfalls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The YOUTH (Tamuramaru) now appears with a
broom in his hand. He says: “The spring has returned,
and the flowers in their prime beauty make
natural offerings for the Goddess of the Temple.
Though there are many places famous for their blossoms
they do not equal these, which are illuminated by the
light of Kannon’s<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> mercy, and this divine mercy, bright
as the autumn moon, even penetrates the village of the
ten evils and shines upon the lake of the five vices.
These flowers look like snow in the garden of the gods
or white sand on the shore of heaven’s sea, in which
the mist and the clouds are all buried. So many of
them there are, and all are cherry flowers, some eight-fold,
some single-fold, as is the way in the spring of
the nine-fold capital. And all the mountains far and
near likewise reflect the season of flowers.”</p>

<p>Beholding the Youth sweeping the petals, the
PRIEST asks him if he is the flower keeper. To this
the YOUTH replies in the affirmative, saying that he
serves the Goddess of the Temple and that as he always
sweeps the petals in the season he may be looked on
as the flower keeper, or at any rate as one in the service
of the Temple.</p>

<p>The PRIEST then asks him to relate minutely the
history of the Temple. Into this narrative the Youth
plunges directly, stating that the Temple was built in
the second year of Daido<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and founded by the wish
of Tamuramaru of Sakanoue. He continues to relate
that there was once a priest called Kenshin who had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
great desire to behold the real form of Kannon, and
after his prayer he once saw a golden-coloured light on
the upper stream of the river Kotsu. He followed it
and found an old man, who said that he was Gyoe-Koji
and told Kenshin to discover a patron who would found
a magnificent temple. But this so-called Gyoe-Koji
was really Kannon herself, and Tamuramaru was the
patron of whom she spoke. The CHORUS then
speaks, for the Youth, of the universal benevolence of
Kannon, symbolised by her thousand merciful hands,
every one of which is ready to be extended to those in
need, in answer to their prayers.</p>

<p>The PRIEST declares that he has met an interesting
person, and asks for further information about the
famous places around, questioning the Youth about one
to the south, where a mound is to be seen, and then
one to the north, whence an evening bell is heard. The
YOUTH, after replying that the one is the Seikan
Temple and the other the Temple of Washinowo, both
famous in poetry, calls the attention of the Priest to
the moon rising from behind the Otowa mountain, and
observes that as the moon casts its peaceful light upon
the cherry blossoms it is a sight truly worth seeing.</p>

<p>The PRIEST says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This is a season to be prized indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This passing moment of a heartless Time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That flies so swiftly in the midst of Spring.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The YOUTH and the PRIEST both repeat: “A
precious moment indeed!” Then together they recite
an old poem: “As precious as a thousand pieces of
gold is one moment of a spring evening with flowers
of pure perfume and the moon of silver brightness,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the YOUTH adding, “Ay, more precious still is this
very moment!”</p>

<p>The CHORUS chants in further praise of the flowers
in the Temple ground&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The moon between the cherry trees shines clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And petals softly falling in the breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dance in the air like gleaming flakes of snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make our hearts dance with them, light and glad.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A second chant of the CHORUS enlarges on the
beauty of the flowers, the greenness of foliage, the
softness of the breeze and the charm of the waterfall of
Otowa, and concludes by referring once more to the
merciful light of the Goddess of the Temple, which is
extended even to inanimate objects, such as trees, and
which accounts for the exquisite scenery of the
surroundings.</p>

<p>The CHORUS then asks (for the Priest) the name
of the Youth, who does not appear to be an ordinary
person. To this the YOUTH replies: “A nameless
man am I, but if thou wishest to know who I am,
observe where I am going.” The CHORUS explains
that the Youth then opens the door of the Shrine of
Tamuramaru, which is brightly lit by the moon, and
disappears within.</p>

<p>The second part of the Play opens with the PRIEST
saying: “Under the shadow of a cherry tree all through
the night I stand, the petals fall and dance in the air,
the moon shines brilliant and clear, and in these
beautiful surroundings I say the midnight prayer.”</p>

<p>TAMURAMARU then appears in the form of a
warrior, saying: “How thankful am I to hear the
voice of prayer, the midnight prayer from a passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
stranger! ’Tis Kannon’s mercy, her help. Oh, how
grateful I am!”</p>

<p>The PRIEST observes how strange it is that he
sees a manly figure in the light of the glittering flowers,
and asks who it is.</p>

<p>To this TAMURAMARU replies that he has now
nothing to conceal, and begins to tell the story of his
life by stating that in the reign of Emperor Heize<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
he was Tamuramaru of Sakanoue, who was to conquer
the Eastern barbarians, the fiends, and that by the help
of the Goddess of this Temple he had power to do it.
The story is then told by the CHORUS, who recounts
that, according to the Emperor’s declaration, the
powerful and rebellious fiends in Seishu must be put
down and peace must be restored. Tamuramaru collected
the army, and when ready to start he came to
this Temple and prayed to Kannon that he might gain
the victory. “There was a strange but good omen,”
breaks in TAMURAMARU, and the CHORUS goes
on to recount with what exultation he set out at once
to strike at the rebels.</p>

<p>Another chant of the CHORUS describes the march
of Tamuramaru and his army to the seat of the rebels.
They travelled far, going over the mountain pass of
Ōsaka and through the forest of Awazu; stopping to
adore the Temple of Ishiyama, noted for its mirage,
where also Kannon is enshrined; and crossing over the
long bridge of Seta, which resounded gallantly as horses
trotted over it. At last they reached the province
of Isé (or Seishu), and, convinced of their victory,
for they were waging a just war, were more encouraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
than ever, every one of them desiring to show his
bravery and strike the first blow at the rebels. Happily,
moreover, with the help of Kannon, the fiends, though
they were numerous, were unconscious of their arrival.</p>

<p>With thundering voice, which shook trees and rivers,
even the mountains, and which echoed through the
heavens and reached to the deepest earth, TAMURAMARU
then spoke thus: “You, fiends, hear what I
say. In older times there was once a rebel called
Chikata, and the heavenly punishment descended upon
him and the fiends who served him, and they were at
once defeated.”</p>

<p>The CHORUS then describes how the fiends came
on in battle, raising thick clouds and pouring down
iron-fire, and by their magic art creating thousands of
armed men. They looked like the sea of Isé, or the
forest of Ano, so mighty were they and so numerous!</p>

<p>TAMURAMARU breaks in: “There behold, how
astonishing!” and the CHORUS goes on to explain
that over his own army the light of the thousand-handed
Kannon appeared, flying in space, with a bow
of mercy and arrows of wisdom in each of her thousand
hands, so that the arrows poured down like rain and
hail over the enemy till all were struck and not one
was left alive. Hence it was by Kannon’s power that
the victory was gained, and to her should be rendered
eternal gratitude.</p>

<p>The play, which was written essentially in praise of
the virtues and powers of Kannon, is attributed to
Motokiyo, the author of Kagekiyo (see p. <a href="#Page_53">53</a>).</p>

<h3>Authorship of the Play</h3>

<p>The play is attributed to <i>Motomasa</i>, who was a grandchild
of the famous Kiyotsugu (see p. <a href="#Page_7">7</a>) and who
died in 1459. The exact date of its composition is
uncertain, but it was most likely within the first half of
the fifteenth century.</p>


<h3>Outline of the Story</h3>

<p>A little child, the only son of his widowed mother (and
owing to the laws regarding the continuation of families
in Japan that means much more there than it does in
Europe), was kidnapped from his home. The play opens
a year after this had happened, and we meet the mother
hurrying toward the Sumida river, which she crosses in
the ferry. She has had a long journey from the City
Royal (Kioto) in her search for the child. While she is in
the ferry, the ferryman tells the passengers of a festival
to be held in the place that evening in memory of a little
lad who died on the road just a year ago. The mother
questions him, and learns that it is <i>her</i> child for whom
the villagers are about to meet in prayer. The ferryman
prevails on her to join in the prayers, and for a
moment the ghost of the little one appears and speaks
with her.</p>

<p><i>This illustration from a Japanese coloured woodcut is
not so good as could be desired, but was the only one
available. It shows the Mother on the left, and reveals
the simple, open way in which the actor wears the
woman’s mask. The little rectangular instrument at her
feet is that used for striking the gong of prayer (<span class="plainfont">see p. <a href="#Page_92">92</a></span>).
The small figure to the right is the ghost of the little son
who died, and whom she has set out to seek. Notice his
entirely unnatural wig of hair. In the square insets above
him are representations of the “Birds of the City Royal”
(<span class="plainfont">see p. <a href="#Page_83">83</a></span>) spoken of so much in the text, and the words
“I adore the Eternal Buddha” in Chinese ideographs.</i>

<h3>Comments on the Play</h3>

<p>In this <i>Nō</i> there is much greater expression of tender,
human sentiment than is common in the pieces. It
contains also several charming descriptions of Nature,
sometimes with a deeper meaning beneath them. For
example&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If one but waits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind vibrates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The branches of the pine trees till they speak.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Throughout the piece also there are very many
allusions to and plays upon classical verses, particularly
in relation to the “Bird of the City Royal” and
Narihira’s poems (see p. <a href="#Page_83">83</a>).</p>

<p>The predominating thought in the piece, however,
is the Buddhistic conception of the transitoriness of
human life, and of the frail nature even of the bond
that unites a loving mother and her child.</p>

<span class="i0">Well, that is a public meeting for a universal prayer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would tell you, while we’re crossing, if you’ll listen to the tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sad story in connection with this festival of ours.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was last year, in the third month, on the fifteenth day, I reckon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes! That is so, and to-day we have the very selfsame day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a kidnapper did journey from the capital, and with him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was a lad whom he had purchased, twelve or thirteen years of age,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He was going to the north-east, but the child was not yet hardened<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the long fatiguing journey made him very sadly ill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was just here by the river that he could go no step farther,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fell down, and there remained. Oh! a heartless man was with him!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the child in that condition by the roadside simply lying<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was abandoned by the merchant who went off to the north-east.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the people of the district nursed and tenderly did treat him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Though I fancy it was really just the Karma of his past),<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something in his childish features and his little ways they noted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if he were of importance, so they watched him carefully.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worse and worse, however, fared he, till the end seemed just approaching,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they asked him&mdash;“Who now art thou? and from whence hast thou just come?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his father’s surname asked I, and the province of his birthplace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“In the capital my home is, and at Kitajirikawa.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he answered; “And my father, who is dead, was Yoshida.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, his one child, had been living with my loving mother only,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But was kidnapped, and was taken far away, and hence my illness.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>

<span class="i0">And to mark the spot I pray thee, be so kind, and plant a willow.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feebly spoke he, and repeated four or five times a calm prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then it ended. A sad story, is it not, that I have told you?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I see now, in this boat, there are some people from the city,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unintentioned though it may be, you will honourably join us<br /></span>

<i>Motome-zuka</i>, which means, the “Sought Tomb.” In older versions
it was previously called <i>Otome-zuka</i>, meaning the “Maiden’s Tomb,”
by which name the story was also known in the <i>Yamato Monogatari</i>
(“Tales of Japan”), written nearly a thousand years ago. <i>Otome</i> and
<i>motome</i> sounding so similar in Japanese, and, as the two men came
<i>seeking</i> the tomb, the name was changed in the text of the Japanese
Nō, but as the older name both has priority and is more euphonious
I revert to the older title.

between city and country life. An old institution among the well-to-do
people of the capital is to make a pleasure picnic for the gathering
of the young green shoots in very early spring. It was a general
custom to eat the “seven greens” on the seventh day of January each
year, and the poor people in the country hamlets make it one of
their slender sources of revenue, to gather these green shoots early in
January, for the city market.</p></div>

the word purple is not actually used, but is called “the related
colour.” As a colour the Japanese word <i>Murasaki</i> is purple, and it
is also applied to a herb with deep purple-coloured flowers. This
plant’s colour is so intensely purple that all the herbs growing near
it are supposed to show the same colour. From such an idea purple
colour is known in poetry as <i>Yukari no iro</i> (the related colour). In
the present lines part of an old stanza is introduced for the sake of
recalling the word <i>murasaki</i>, and this in turn leads on to <i>yukari no na</i>
in the first line of the Chorus.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Page 44&mdash;According to an old tale a lover, crossing a
pontoon bridge, fell between the boats and was drowned. The
Chorus supposes the heroine to be thinking, “Like this man I too
died because of love, and the ‘Bridge of Love’ is a name which is
<i>related</i> (see note <a href="#Footnote_20_20">11</a>) to my own destiny.”</p></div>

herbs. Chōan is in China, and the old name of China was <i>Kara</i>, so
that the mention of Chōan brings <i>Kara</i> to mind, which in turn

short growth of the summer horns is used to express the idea of brief
time. An alternative translation of this line would be, “Short is my
night’s sleep, short are a stag’s horns,” but these words do not
convey to an English reader anything like the meaning the Japanese
carries. In the original the word <i>tsuka</i> means either a “tomb” or a
“grasp,” and it acts as a pivot word. In the sense of “tomb” it
leads to the weeds growing on her tomb, which is the essential part;
and in the sense of “grasp” it suggests shortness, and inasmuch as a
stag’s horns are so short in summer as to be within the grasp of a
hand, their shortness is suggested, and this in turn suggests a night’s
sleep in summer. This train of thought would probably not occur
had it not been rendered a classical picture by an old and well-known
stanza.</p></div>

province through which they passed, means “three rivers,” which
leads to the idea of bridges. But more than that, Mikana is noted
for its eight bridges, spanning over the streams which branch off like
the legs of a spider, which is <i>kumo</i> in Japanese; and this idea leads on
to that of “clouds,” which are pronounced <i>kumo</i>, though written
with a different ideagraph. The idea of “clouds” leads on, finally,
to that of the “capital,” where only those of high rank “above the
clouds” are dwelling.</p></div>
